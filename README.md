# 📝 Notes App

A clean and responsive **note-taking web app** built using:

- **Express.js** (backend framework)
- **EJS** (templating engine)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first styling)
- **Node.js** local file system (to store notes)

This app lets users create, view, and edit notes — perfect for learning full-stack concepts or building a lightweight local note keeper.
